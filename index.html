		Welcome!! My name is Ben Myhre and I am actively seeking development work. I love working on problems and believe that every industry has interesting problems to work on. I would love to find the right team that I can add to and learn from. Please look around to get a sense of what I enjoy doing.

			<strong>About Codefusion</strong><br>
			Codefusion was my capstone project at Dev Bootcamp. This application allows a teacher to broadcast his code (either a file or a folder) using whatever text-editor he wants. Then, students can watch the instructor and take notes on a file by file basis. When desired, the student can download the entire project locally into a zip file.<br>

			Technologies used: Ruby (ruby gem), Firebase, Ember, Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3
		</div>
		<div class="bacon text">
			<strong>Fifty Shades of Bacon</strong><br>
			Yup... I made this. One day, the idea popped into my head. Even though I had never even considered writing a book before, by the end of that day, I decided I was going to write a cookbook and I did. In less than 2 months, the final project was for sale on Amazon and has went on to be a best seller in the Meats category in Amazon since first brought to market nearly 2 years ago. It has brought interesting opportunities, including an interview with Seattle Kitchen, an article in Allure magazine and being known as the bacon guy by way too many people.
			<br>
			Technologies used: Brining. Smoking meats, Lipitor, Wordpress (there is a site out there that really needs some review!) 
		</div>
		<div class="beard text">
			<strong>Rate my Beard</strong><br>
			This was a project created midway through Dev Bootcamp. The ultimate goal with this one is to create a Beard Battle sort of website where users can dual. For this iteration, however, basically a hot or not for Beards. Why?  Why not.
			<br>
			Technologies used: Instagram API, Javascript, jQuery, Heroku, Sinatra, PostgreSQL
		</div>
		<div class="star-fours text">
			<strong>Star Fours</strong><br>
			This was my first semi-serious delve into JS. We build a Connect Four clone and what better way to make a sort-of-fun thing 100x better than to put a Star Wars wrapper around it. Although the tried and true Star Wars fans will recognize that my colors for the empire/rebel army are a little messed up, they may also recognize that sometimes decisions need to be made to meet timelines! 
			<br>
			Technologies used: Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3
		</div>
		<div class="twitter text">
			<strong>Twitter</strong><br>
			Check out my Twitter
			<br>
			Technologies used: Characters... 140 of them, to be exact
		</div>
		<div class="linkedin text">
			<strong>LinkedIn</strong><br>
			Check out my LinkedIn
			<br>
			Technologies used: The LinkedIn technologies.
		</div>
		<div class="github text">
			<strong>GitHub</strong><br>
			Check out my GitHub
			<br>
			Technologies used: All of the ones in my universe of knowledge, and like the universe, the body of technologies I can use is expanding. Hopefully for a long... long time.
