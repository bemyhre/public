This is a redo of my website, yo. 

V1 was some fairly simple html/css stuff that was a part of phase 0.

V2 is wordpress. I wanted something a little bit more polished immediately so that employers could look at it.

V3 is back to my own. I plan on adding a carasol for the images. I probably will still use WP for the blog portion, but might investigate something a littl more lightweight. I mean..... it is huge for what I really want to accomplish.
